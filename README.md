# Operations-Analytics
This Project aims to understand and explain the sudden changes in key metrics, such as dip in daily user engagement or a drop in engagement backed by the data driven insights. We will be analyzing different data sets to derive meaningful insights from the data to answer questions posed by different departments within the company and support operational efficiency.
